      "kindWords": "I worked with Sigurd at Vertu Motors.  He is highly skilled and fastidious in his work and, when given a task that was outside of his expertise, quickly got himself up to speed with the processes and technology issues to a point where he was quickly able to mentor other team members.   He is very definitely a team player who is willing to take on any tasks that come his way and to help and support other members of the team. He took on the responsibility for certain tricky tasks that other team members were unwilling to. He quickly moved from being 'one of the team' in these tasks to being the lead developer.  He is active in meetings, asking useful questions and 'leaving no stone unturned' which makes understanding the issues easier for everyone.  I would highly recommend Sigurd as a valuable member of any team."
